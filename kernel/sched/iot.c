/*
 * IOT scheduler template
 * The purpose of this scheduler is to implement a simple scheduler named IoT scheduler.
 * scheduler that outperforms CFS scheduler by asserting real-time priority when running the surveillance system in a busy environment.
 * The template here is for the students to implement the correct source code for the IoT scheduler.
 * For this assignment, the students are expected to modify
 *
 * 1. select_task_rq_iot
 * 2. enqueue_task_iot
 * 3. dequeue_task_iot
 * 4. pick_next_task_iot
 * 5. rq_online_iot
 * 6. rq_offline_iot
 *
 * Please refer to the FIXME: lines where lines briefly explain what implementation the scheduler expects as a minimum requirement.
 *
 * Regarding to implementing other functions.
 * The basic requirement is to have the basic scheduler working without task preemption and load-balancing while running on multiple CPUs.
 * However, students are encouraged to add the preemption and load-balancing if the time is alloweded
